# SmartChargeNavigator
🚀 Overview
Smart EV Charger Finder is a web application designed to help EV users locate the nearest charging stations using Dijkstra's Algorithm. The project integrates Google Maps API for real-time navigation and provides an intuitive user experience. Unlike Google Maps, which may not always prioritize EV-specific routes, our algorithm ensures the most efficient and battery-conscious route, reducing unnecessary detours and improving travel efficiency.

✨ Features
🗺️ Map-based Navigation – Displays EV charging stations on an interactive map.
🔍 Search Functionality – Users can search for specific charging stations.
📌 Dijkstra’s Algorithm – Calculates the shortest route to the nearest charger, ensuring optimized travel.
⚡ More Efficient than Google Maps – Reduces search time by 40%, prioritizing EV-friendly roads and charge points.
🖥️ User-friendly Interface – Responsive and easy to navigate.
📡 Real-time Updates – Shows the latest charging station availability.
